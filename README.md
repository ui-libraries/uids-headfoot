# UIDS header and footer

## Goal
Libraries' UIDS (University of Iowa Design System - [brand.uiowa.edu](https://brand.uiowa.edu/)) compliant header and footer with minimal dependencies that can be applied to any site.

## Working assumptions
- Most styles and behaviors will be dependencies (e.g., using a CDN or one of our servers) so edits/updates can be made centrally.
- Start with a skinny header and a full footer as the default. This is what we currently use for all brandable offerings.

## Example
[https://ui-libraries.github.io/uids-headfoot/](https://ui-libraries.github.io/uids-headfoot/)

## The salient files for porting the Libraries' UIDS header and footer to other sites are:
- docs/_includes/uids-headfoot.css
- docs/_includes/uids-header.html
- docs/_includes/uids-footer.html
