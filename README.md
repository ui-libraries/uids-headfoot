# UIDS header and footer
UIDS-branded Libraries header and footer with minimal dependencies that can be applied to any site.

## Working assumptions
- Most styles and behaviors will be dependencies (e.g., using a CDN) so tweaks can be made centrally.
- Start with a skinny header and a full footer as the default.

## Example
[https://s-lib024.lib.uiowa.edu/portable-branding/example.php](https://s-lib024.lib.uiowa.edu/portable-branding/example.php)

## USE THIS CSS
 - https://s-lib024.lib.uiowa.edu/portable-branding/css/portable.css

## Salient files
- includes
	- uids-header.html
	- uids-footer.html
- css
	- portable.css

## To do
- [x] I will add ths sass/scss files soon.
- [ ] Update the social media icons SVG to match https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/.
- [ ] Skinny footer - maybe.
- [ ] Global Libraries navigation might get stored here, also.
