# UIDS header and footer
UIDS-branded Libraries header and footer with minimal dependencies that can be applied to any site.

## Working assumptions
- Most styles and behaviors will be dependencies (e.g., using a CDN) so tweaks can be made centrally.
- Start with a skinny header and a full footer as the default.

## Example
